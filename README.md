# DiSC Demo

## Introduction

The demo would provide a real-time and interactive experience to a user on how the system employs the principle of gossiping and hashing techniques in a novel way for fast approximate score computation. The user can control different aspects of the systemâ€™s execution on a cluster with up to 32 nodes. The approximate scores downloaded can be then used by existing score-based structure learning algorithms.
